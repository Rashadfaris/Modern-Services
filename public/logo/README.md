This folder is for your site logo files.

- Add your logo image here, for example: `Modern-Services/public/logo/modern-services-logo.png`
- In your React components, you can reference it with a root-relative path, e.g.:
  - `<img src="/logo/modern-services-logo.png" alt="Modern Services logo" />`

Files in the `public` directory are served as static assets by Vite and available at the root of your deployed site.
